	'As an example, Aarhus municipality has a strategic goal of increasing the forest cover by 3200 hectares before 2030. Approximately 200 hectares (2 km2) of forest needs to be raised each year to reach that target. With this tool, we can calculate how much forest is raised, month by month, until 2030 (and beyond). This way, everyone can follow the progress of efforts to make Denmark greener.',

In this example, we have used a combination of LIDAR intensity data, a normalised elevation model (nDSM), GeoDK vector reference data and aerial imagery (10 cm resolution) to map and quantify the amount of green objects in Gedser, Denmark.',
